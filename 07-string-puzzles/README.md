# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * substring(a) is a method is sub out whatever number you put for (a), whatever number you put in, it will sub out what you put in it, for example substring(0) for the string apple, it will print out "a". 

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * substring(a, b) will substitute whatever number is between a and b out from the string, so for example if the string is apple and the substring is like (0,2) it will remove the first three letters, therefore the printed string will be "le". 

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * indexOf will make it so when it reaches the first occurence it will stop, for example if the string is "apple" and .indexOf is .indexOf(p), it will stop at the first p we see. 

  * `.equals(str)`
    * It will compare the two strings so if somethings equals to the (str), it will print as true since it equals each other. 

2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * The value for the s indicates how much times the for loop will run before the code breaks for example if the s is identified as 5. The for loop will run 5 times, but if it loops until the number 5 or more the for loop breaks so therefore the code will end.
