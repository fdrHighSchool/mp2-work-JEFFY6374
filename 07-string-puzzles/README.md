# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**

  * `.equals(str)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * The value for the s indicates how much times the for loop will run before the code breaks for example if the s is identified as 5. The for loop will run 5 times, but if it loops until the number 5 or more the for loop breaks so therefore the code will end.
