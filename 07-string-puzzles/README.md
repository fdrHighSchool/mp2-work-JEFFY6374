# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * substring(a, b) will substitute whatever number is between a and b out from the string, so for example if the string is apple and the substring is like (0,2) it will remove the first three letters, therefore the printed string will be "le". 

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**

  * `.equals(str)`
    * **YOUR WRITING HERE**


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * The value for the s indicates how much times the for loop will run before the code breaks for example if the s is identified as 5. The for loop will run 5 times, but if it loops until the number 5 or more the for loop breaks so therefore the code will end.
